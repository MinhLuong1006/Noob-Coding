### A boolean expression is an expression that is either True or False

```python
5 == 5
>>>> True

5 == 6
>>>> False
```

### The == is one of the comparison operators, the others are:

| Expressions |           Meaning            |
| :---------: | :--------------------------: |
|    x > y    |     x is greater than y      |
|    x < y    |       x is less than y       |
|   x >= y    |  x is greater or equal to y  |
|   x <= y    | x is less than or equal to y |
|   x is y    |      x is the same as y      |
| x is not y  |    x is not the same as y    |
|   x != y    |     x is not equal to y      |


| Logical operators |                                Meaning                                |
| :---------------: | :-------------------------------------------------------------------: |
|        and        | x > 0 and x < 10 is true only if x is greater than 0 and less then 10 |
|        or         |   n%3 == 0 or n%2 == 0 is true if either of the conditions is true    |
|        not        | It negates a boolean expression, so not(x>y) is true if x>y is false  |
