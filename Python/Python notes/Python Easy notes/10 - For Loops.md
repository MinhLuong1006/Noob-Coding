### For Loops are used to execute a block of code a fixed number of times. You can iterate over a range, string, sequence, etc.
```python
#use for loop to print from 1 to 5

for x in range(1,6): #since the 2nd number is exclusive so we write 11 
	print x

#Output: 1
#        2
#        3
#        4
#        5
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#use for loop to print odd numbers only from 1 to 10
for x in range(1,11,2): #since the 2nd number is exclusive so we write 11 
	print x

#Output: 1
#        3
#        5
#        7
#        9
```
